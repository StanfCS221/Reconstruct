# Reconstruct

Tests and solutions for Stanford's CS221 class. My part of code is in 'submission.py' file between 'BEGIN_YOUR_CODE' and 'END_YOUR_CODE'. Tests can be executed by running 'grader.py' file. More information about the assignment can be found by opening 'index.html' file. Solutions to the written part of the assignments are not published but I am happy to discuss them in person. This specific repo is focused on Search problems. Get an input of English sentence with spaces, vowels or both removed, return the most 'fluent' version of this sentence with spaces and/or vowels added. 'Fluency' is learned on 2 books in English based on existing words and words connections ('rabbit' is a word, 'rabbit jumps' is likely to be a thing). A lot of fancy things combined with knowledge of English language is used to lower the number of states examined.
