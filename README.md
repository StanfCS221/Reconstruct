Tests and solutions for Stanford's CS221 class. This specific repo is focused on Search problems. Get an input of English sentence with spaces, vowels or both removed, return the most 'fluent' version of this sentence with spaces and/or vowels added. 'Fluency' is learned on 2 books in English based on existing words and words connections ('rabbit' is a word, 'rabbit jumps' is likely to be a thing). A lot of fancy things combined with knowledge of English language is used to lower the number of states examined.
